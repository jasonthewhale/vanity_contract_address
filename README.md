# vanity_contract_address
Calculate a vanity contract address with "create2"
Use javascript to do the calculation and solidity to deploy contracts.

Theoretically, you can iterate with purely solidity, but that gonna be super costly since every loop consume some gas. Also, this process is extremely slow compared to js.
